# Building Microservices

## What are Micro services?

Microservices are independently releasable services that are modeled around a business domain. A service encapsulates functionality and makes it accessible to other services via networksâ€”you construct a more complex system from these building blocks. Microservices are an architecture choice that is focused on giving you many options for solving the problems you might face.

A single microservice is treated as a black box(Internal implementation details such as way data is stored, code are hidden from outside world). It hosts business
functionality on one or more network endpoints over few protocols.
Microservice architectures avoid the use of shared databases in most circumstances; instead, each microservice encapsulates its own database where required.

SOA(Service oriented Architecture) and Microservices are different. SOA focus on large monolithic applications & promotes reusability of software. It doesn't split system, no communicaiton protocols(SOAP) etc. The microservice approach has emerged from real-world use, taking our better understanding of systems and architecture to do SOA well.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF MICROSERVICES

1. Indepandant Deployability

    Make sure our microservices are loosely coupled with stable interfaces else problems from sharing databases will cause problems. 

2. Modeled Around a Business Domain

    By modeling services around business domains, we can make it easier to roll out new functionality and to recombine microservices in different ways to deliver new functionality to our users, our code better represent the real world domain.

    Each layer in architecture represent a different service boundary.

    With microservices we have made a decision to prioritize high cohesion of business functionality over high cohesion of technical functionality. 

3. Owning their own State

   We want to think of our services as end-to-end slices of business functionality that, where appropriate, encapsulate user interface (UI), business logic, and data. This is because we want to reduce the effort needed to change business-related functionality. This gives us high cohesion of business functionality, reduce coupling.

4. Size
    How many microservices can you handle? more services - more complexity of system.

    How do you define microservice boundaries to get most out of them without mess?

5. Flexibility
    Finding a balance between keeping your options open and bearing the cost of architectures like this can be a real art.

6. Alignment of Architecture and Organization

    3tier architecture is old method and changes will need to be managed by each team and deployed in the correct order, as outlined in figure. This architecture has high cohesion of related technology but low cohesion of business functionality.

    We organize them in terms of the way we break our systems apart as there is need to ship software much more quickly these days. A single dedicated team that has full-end-to-end responsibility for making changes to aspects of the customer profile.

    This could be achieved through a single microservice owned by the profile team that exposes a UI to allow customers to update their information, with state of the customer also stored within this microservice. This is a vertical approach.

## THE MONOLITH

1. The Single-Process Monolith

    A system in which all of the code is deployed as a single process, an architecture which makes sense for smaller organizations. Processes such as reading data from or storing data into a database, or pretending information to web or mobile applications.

2. The Modular Monolith

    Each module can be worked on independently, but all still need to be combined together for deployment.

    Shopify uses modular monolith. If the module boundaries are well defined, it can allow for a high degree of parallel work, while avoiding the challenges of the more distributed microservice architecture by having a much simpler deployment topology. Databases tend to lack decomposition in code level, pulling apart the monolith is challenge, some tried with database decomposition(having seperate databases for different modules).

3. The Distributed Monolith

    A system with multiple services but entire system must be deployed together which is a disadvantage. This architecture is used in information hiding, cohesion of business functionality.

Monoliths and Delivery Contention

    Delivery contention is many developers wanting to push functionality live at different times and confusion around who owns what and who makes decisions. A microservice architecture does give you more concrete boundaries around which ownership lines can be drawn in a system.


## Advantages of Monoliths


## Enabling Technology

Microservices require an understanding of the supporting technology to such a degree that previous distinctions
between logical and physical architecture can be problematic.

### Log Aggregation and Distributed Tracing

Log aggregation tool is so essential in understanding how system is behaving, that you should consider it a prerequisite for adopting microservices. These systems allow you to collect and aggregate logs from across all your services, providing you a central place from which logs can be analyzed, and even made part of an active alerting mechanism.
Implementing correlation IDs, in which a single ID is used for a related set of service calls. By logging this ID as part of each log entry, isolating the logs associated with a given flow of calls becomes much easier, which in turn makes troubleshooting much easier.
Ex - Jaeger, Lightstep, Honeycomb etc.

### Containers and Kubernetes

Normal virtualization techniques used for microservice instance isolation can be quite heavy when we consider the size of our microservices.
Containers, on the other hand, provide a much more lightweight way to provision isolated execution for service instances, resulting in faster spin-up times for new container instances, along with being much more cost effective for many architectures.
Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes provide the robustness and throughput your service needs while allowing you to manage underlying containers and use them efficiently. Deploying kubernetes is complex, there is a tradeoff of their adoption.

### Streaming

Organizations are wanting to move away from batch reporting operations and toward more real-time feedback, allowing them to react more quickly. Apache Kafka is choice for straming data in a microservice environment. Kafka has started adding stream-processing capabilities in the form of KSQLDB, but you can also use it with dedicated stream-processing solutions like Apache Flink.

### Public Cloud and Serverless

Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Public cloud providers offer a host of managed services, from managed database instances or Kubernetes clusters to message brokers or distributed filesystems.
Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms are of special interest because they provide a nice abstraction around the deployment of code.
